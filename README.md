German-credit-card-fraud-analysis


# Description
This project focuses on assessing credit risk using the German Credit dataset. By implementing machine learning models, we aim to accurately predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on various financial and personal attributes. The project explores different models to classify individuals into 'good' or 'bad' credit risks, aiding in the decision-making process for lending.

# Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

scikit-learn for machine learning models
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
matplotlib for data visualization
Install these dependencies using pip:


pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

# Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local environment.
Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Open the german_credit.ipynb notebook and run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis and model training.
Data
The dataset includes various attributes such as age, job, credit history, credit amount, and other personal information, categorized into 'good' or 'bad' credit risks. We performed preprocessing steps, including normalization of numerical features using MinMaxScaler to prepare the data for modeling.

# Models
The project investigates the following machine learning models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): To classify applicants based on the similarity of their attributes.
Logistic Regression: A statistical model used for binary classification tasks, predicting the probability of an individual being a 'good' or 'bad' credit risk.
Results
Our evaluation strategy included the use of confusion_matrix and accuracy_score to measure the performance of our models. Here are the key findings:

The Logistic Regression model demonstrated notable accuracy, evaluated separately on training and test datasets to assess overfitting or underfitting.
Detailed performance metrics, including accuracy scores for both models, provided insights into their effectiveness in classifying credit risks.
